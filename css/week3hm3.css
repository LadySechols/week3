/* <!-- The html document should be named flex.html & the css document should be named flex.css. I'm not looking for you to pixel perfect re-create this design just the general idea. Feel free to take some creative freedoms like: color/font/margin/padding/size adjustments. I made the site responsive and you are encouraged to do so as well if you'd like however it is NOT required and will not be factored into your grade. I'm going to set it due for Monday morning 2/8/2021 since it took me some time to post here. Push your work to the "week3" repo --> */
